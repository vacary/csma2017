  abstract =	 {This paper presents a new formulation of the
                  dynamical Coulomb friction problem in finite
                  dimension with discretized time. The novelty of our
                  approach is to capture and treat directly the
                  friction model as a parametric quadratic
                  optimization problem with second-order cone
                  constraints coupled with a fixed point
                  equation. This intrinsic formulation allows a simple
                  existence proof under reasonable assumptions, as
                  well as a variety of solution algorithms. We study
                  mechanical interpretations of these assumptions,
                  showing in particular that they are actually
                  necessary and sufficient for a basic example similar
                  to the so-called “paradox of Painlevé”. Finally, we
                  present some implementations and experiments to
                  illustrate the practical aspect of our work.},
