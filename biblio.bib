                  dynamical Coulomb friction problem in finite
                  dimension with discretized time. The novelty of our
                  approach is to capture and treat directly the
                  friction model as a parametric quadratic
                  optimization problem with second-order cone
                  constraints coupled with a fixed point
                  equation. This intrinsic formulation allows a simple
                  existence proof under reasonable assumptions, as
                  well as a variety of solution algorithms. We study
                  mechanical interpretations of these assumptions,
                  showing in particular that they are actually
                  necessary and sufficient for a basic example similar
                  to the so-called “paradox of Painlevé”. Finally, we
                  present some implementations and experiments to
                  illustrate the practical aspect of our work.},

  abstract =	 "{This book concerns the numerical simulation of
                  dynamical systems whose trajectories may be not
                  differentiable. These systems are called nonsmooth
                  dynamical systems, and they represent an important
                  class of systems, firstly because of many
                  applications in which nonsmooth models are useful,
                  secondly because they give rise to new problems in
                  various fields of mathematics and computational
                  mechanics.  The book is divided into three parts.
                  The first part presents the formulation of nonsmooth
                  dynamical systems, with model problems from
                  mechanics, electricity and control, as well as
                  useful material from convex and nonsmooth analysis
                  related to differential inclusions, variational
                  inequalities, and complementarity systems. The model
                  applications are taken from multibody systems with
                  contact, impact and friction, and from electrical
                  circuits with piecewise linear and ideal components.
                  The second part deals with numerical
                  time-integration schemes, which can be divided into
                  event-driven schemes and time-stepping schemes.  The
                  third part is devoted to one-step nonsmooth problem
                  solvers, and includes techniques suitable for the
                  solution of variational inequalities, nonlinear
                  programming problems and complementarity
                  problems. The one-step problems include the
                  nonlinear models known as holonomic models, which
                  have a long tradition in engineering mechanics (cf.
                  unilateral contact for static elastic bodies, the
                  holonomic or Hencky model of plasticity). Nonsmooth
                  modelling in mechanics is based on the seminal works
                  of J. J. Moreau and T. Rockafellar on convex
                  analysis and its usage in contact mechanics and
                  elastoplasticity, as well as on later extensions to
                  nonconvex problems by P. D. Panagiotopoulos. This
                  development has been documented in a number of
                  research monographs like [{\it R. T. Rockafellar},
                  Convex Analysis. Princeton Landmarks in
                  Mathematics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University
                  Press (1997; Zbl 0932.90001); {\it P. D.
                  Panagiotopoulos}, Inequality problems in mechanics
                  and applications. Convex and nonconvex energy

                  etc.: Springer-Verlag (1988; Zbl 0652.00016)] and in
                  many others.  Practical applications of nonsmooth
                  mechanics are also presented in research monographs,
                  see e.g. [{\it F. Pfeiffer, C. Glocker}, Multibody
                  dynamics with unilateral contacts. CISM Courses and
                  Lectures. 421. Wien etc.: Springer-Verlag (2000; Zbl
                  0960.00025)].  The present book is a research
                  monograph with numerous information and references
                  to original publications which gives to the book an
                  encyclopaedic nature. The wealth of information and
                  solution methods mentioned in this book certainly
                  shows that the area of nonsmooth mechanics has
                  arrived a level of maturity that allows for serious
                  industrial applications, without loosing its
                  attractiveness for research purposes. The parallel
                  presentation of nonsmooth models in mechanics and
                  electronics indicates that the mentioned effects
                  will also be of interest for people working in
                  mechatronics, microelectromechanics and
                  multiphysics.  The book is intended for graduate
                  students and scientists doing research and
                  development in mechanics and electrical engineering,
                  designers of modern electromechanical devices, as
                  well as to researchers from other scientific
                  communities like applied mathematics, robotics,
                  civil and mechanical engineering, mechatronics,
